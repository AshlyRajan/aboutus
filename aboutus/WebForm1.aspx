        <p>There is rarely a need to outright say, “Our vision/mission is built a invension in technology,” but you ought to convey the purpose of your business in your About Us copy.

Talk about why your brand exists, what makes you different, and the challenges you solve – beyond the obvious solution you sell.

This is key for attracting talent, as well as prospective buyers who align with your objectives and value goals.</p>
